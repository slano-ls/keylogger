# Keylogger

A simple Keylogger implemented in C which stores your keylogging information to `/var/log/keystroke.log`  which you can then see. 

Requires **Accessibility** access, and is more of a *POC* than an actual functional product. 

To install, 

`git clone https://github.com/slano-ls/keylogger`
`cd keylogger`
`make`
`keylogger` 

Then allow accessibility and enjoy!
